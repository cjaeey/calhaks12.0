## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Start Python Agents (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/carlosescala/calhacks12.0/calhaks12.0/agents_python

# Set API keys (if you haven't already)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_key_here"
export YELP_API_KEY="your_key_here"

# Activate environment and start agents
source venv/bin/activate
python coordinator_agent.py
```

**What this does:**
- Starts all 4 agents in a Bureau on ports 8000-8004
- Agents can communicate with each other
- Ready for Agentverse registration

**Keep this terminal running!**

### Step 2: Expose with ngrok (OPTIONAL - For Agentverse Registration)

Only needed if you want to register on Agentverse during the demo:

```bash
# In a NEW terminal
brew install ngrok  # One-time install
ngrok http 8000     # Expose coordinator agent
```

Copy the `https://xxx.ngrok.io` URL - you'll need it for Step 3.

### Step 3: Register on Agentverse (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://agentverse.ai
2. Sign up or login
3. Click "My Agents" → "+ New Agent"
4. Fill in the form:

```yaml
Agent Name: ReNOVA Coordinator
Agent Address: agent1qw9dtncvja2e4t2lq8w86dwtrkwmuzwd64dcspsq8y5eet638ww82lk92fg
Description: AI-powered contractor matching system using Claude AI
Endpoint URL: https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/submit  # Replace with YOUR ngrok URL
Protocols: CoordinatorProtocol
```

5. Click "Create Agent"

**Done!** Your agent is now discoverable on Fetch.ai's Agentverse!

## 🎬 Demo Strategy

### Option A: Local Demo (Easiest - 5 minutes)

**Best if:** You want to focus on functionality over deployment

**What to show:**
1. Terminal with all 4 agents running (show agent addresses)
2. Submit a job via frontend or curl
3. Watch message flow in logs:
   ```
   🚀 Coordinator: Received job abc123
   📋 IntakeAgent: Analyzing with Claude...
   ✅ IntakeAgent: Job scope created
   🔍 ScraperAgent: Searching Yelp...
   ✅ ScraperAgent: Found 8 professionals
   🎯 MatcherAgent: Ranking with Claude...
   ✅ MatcherAgent: Top matches ready
   🎉 Pipeline complete!
   ```
4. Show matched contractors with AI reasoning

**What to say:**
> "We built a multi-agent system using Fetch.ai's uAgents SDK. Here you can see 4 autonomous agents coordinating to match contractors with customers. Each agent has its own address and runs independently. They're designed to deploy to Agentverse for decentralized operation."

### Option B: Agentverse Demo (Most Impressive - 10 minutes)

**Best if:** You want to show full Fetch.ai integration

**What to show:**
1. Agentverse dashboard with registered agent
2. Agent address proving it's real
3. Local agents running and processing jobs
4. Message flow between agents

**What to say:**
> "Our agents are deployed on Fetch.ai's Agentverse. This is a fully decentralized agent network where autonomous agents can discover and communicate with each other. Our coordinator agent orchestrates 3 specialized agents - one for AI analysis, one for data scraping, and one for ranking - all running autonomously."

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Python agents won't start?
```bash
cd /Users/carlosescala/calhacks12.0/calhaks12.0/agents_python
source venv/bin/activate
python -c "import uagents; import anthropic; print('✅ OK')"
# If error, reinstall:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Check agent addresses?
```bash
python get_agent_info.py
```

### Ports already in use?
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :8000-8004
# Kill if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### ngrok not working?
```bash
ngrok version  # Check installation
ngrok http 8000 --log=stdout  # Verbose mode
```

### Need API keys?
```bash
# Anthropic Claude: https://console.anthropic.com/
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Yelp Fusion: https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
export YELP_API_KEY="your-yelp-key..."
```
