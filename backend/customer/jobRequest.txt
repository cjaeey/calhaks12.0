My home should feel like it has a history and a story. I have old family furniture and like buying vintage pieces. I need a designer who is great at mixing these antiques with new, modern furniture so the whole place feels cozy, stylish, and fresh, not dusty or dated.

I need a designer who is obsessed with bright, bold colour. I want walls that are deep blue, bright yellow, or rich greenâ€”not just safe white or beige. They need to believe that colour can change the way a room feels.

They must be careful and thorough. I want someone who looks closely at every detail, from the doorknobs to the rug. The design should be perfectly finished, blending traditional craft skills with any modern tools they use.
