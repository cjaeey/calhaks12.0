Really loving stripes lately! Anyone else in love with stripes or do you have a favourite pattern? ðŸ’–

Itâ€™s a wet and windy morning here in Limerick today. Time for some cosy activities this week - reading, baking and more planning for the renovation! Weâ€™re making great progress with the kitchen planning. Canâ€™t wait to share more ðŸ©·

Happy Saturday! Still mulling over what to do with the main sitting room. The drawing room will be fuschia so it might be too much to have the sitting room pink too? Tempting though! What would you do? ðŸ’ž

AD/ Itâ€™s @dfs New Sofa Day! Iâ€™ve recently helped my sister design her living room refresh, but what she doesnâ€™t know is that the sofa is arriving TODAY! While she was out, the DFS team delivered the Serenis sofa. I got to work styling the space and making it beautiful for the big reveal. The room was inspired by the DFS Shoreline Sanctuary trend - itâ€™s giving coastal chic! I was so excited to surprise her and she was thrilled with the final look! Thatâ€™s what big sisters are for.

Iâ€™d love to know what you think of the transformation?

I need to start thinking about the hallway next! Itâ€™s quite dark and north facing, so should I lean into and try this shade of green? ðŸ’š Or try and make it brighter? 

Iâ€™m thinking panelling with a chinoiserie patterned wallpaper on top. Wallpaper suggestions welcome!

AD/ Living room before & after and styling tips!
 
Donâ€™t you just love a good before and after? I recently helped my sister, Pam, refresh her living room. We were inspired by the @dfs Shoreline Sanctuary trend and wanted a luxe, coastal aesthetic. We chose the DFS Serenis sofa in oatmeal. Itâ€™s a gorgeous, classic shape in a beautifully soft fabric. Itâ€™s the perfect base for styling, so I added patterned cushions, ceramics, artwork and fresh flowers to bring the coastal vibe to life. I also love how you can push in the footstool to create a GIANT sofa â€“ perfect for movie nights! Iâ€™m absolutely obsessed with this sofa!

I would love to know what you think?

Hi! I thought Iâ€™d reintroduce myself as I have a few new friends on this account. Iâ€™m Jen, a creative director based in Limerick in the west of Ireland. 3 years ago, we bought a 240 year old Georgian house in the countryside and bit by bit we are doing it up. Iâ€™m a lover of English, Irish and French interior design - from charming country cottages to glittering chateaux. I adore hunting for antiques and vintage furniture and decor. I love faded glamour and lots of colour in my interior design. On my account, I share photos and videos of my home and garden, so you can follow us on our lifelong journey to make this house our home. I also share some lifestyle and beauty bits. More recently, Iâ€™ve been experimenting with designing and rendering spaces with the help of AI. Iâ€™ve been loving this new outlet for developing ideas for the rooms in my home Iâ€™ve yet to complete. Itâ€™s also lovely to conjure up dreamy images to share inspiration with you for your own home. Iâ€™d love if you could let me know what youâ€™d like to see on this account. More of the same? Something different? Please let me know in the comments! Thanks for following along ðŸŒ¸ðŸŽ€ðŸ©·
Continuing on the pink theme! ðŸ©·ðŸ’• 

How much is too much?!
